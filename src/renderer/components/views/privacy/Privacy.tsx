About World Scholarship Foundation’s NFT
</h1>
<p>
Scholaroids NFT are the avatars of the Scholarship Rewards system. In the near future, a Scholaroid NFT will be automatically minted when a new user student has an account created. This Scholaroid will evolve throughout the course of the student’s studies. Each are original and never one will be exactly the same. 
</p>
<p>
Scholaroids represent the strength of diversity and knowledge within the world community. Each are complimented with their own set of features. 
</p>
<p>
This set of Scholaroids have been created in the name of Ukrainians that are faced with an unprecedented and unwanted war inflicted by Vladimir Putin himself, for his own interest. A war that even the Russian population themselves do not understand due to their authoritarian government controlling mass media in their country.

</p>
<p>
We have decided to dedicate these Scholaroids to the Ukrainian people. For their strength to defend their freedom and country. These avatars represent defenders of Freedom and peace.
</p>
<p>
Each minted Scholaroid are custom and come with various features such as hats, hairstyle, clothe, weapon and background. All are different.
